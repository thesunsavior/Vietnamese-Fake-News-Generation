For the Russians who were holding guns on the Ukrainian side on the battlefield, secrets were the most important thing. They were members of an army called "Freedom of Russia." The exact number of members was strictly confidential. They never revealed the location, and the statements they made were always careful in every word. On a recent cold winter morning, the 50-year-old spokesman of the corps, codenamed Caesar, passed by the remnants of an Orthodox monastery in Dolina, the village in the eastern Donetsk region, which Russian troops had just recaptured from Russian forces in the autumn. Among its ruins was a shattered onion-shaped golden dome, a stucco lion, and religious symbols scattered on the ground. In Ceasar's words, the ruined scene showed the world how terrible the consequences of the conflict were.

Still, while the Pence revelations clearly do Biden a favor, they also provide an inadvertent political opening for Trump. That’s because it may be difficult for many voters not steeped in the details of the document saga to distinguish the nuances of the trio of cases. The more such stashes are unearthed, and the more top current and former executive branch officials are involved, the more it seems that such discoveries are no big deal or that everyone involved is equally at fault.

There appear to still be clear legal grounds to show that Trump’s retention of hundreds of documents when he left office – as well as attempts to stop their return and to obstruct the investigation – could reach the level of criminality. But the widening documents controversy – and the revelations about other leaders – threatens to undermine such a potential finding by the Justice Department.

Any suggestion that Trump is being singled out and treated unfairly, even if it is unfounded, will be used by the ex-president to bolster his claims he’s the victim of political persecution. The stakes are especially inflammatory given his declared 2024 presidential campaign.
